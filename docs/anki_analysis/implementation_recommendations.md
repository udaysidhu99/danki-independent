**Purpose**: Concrete roadmap for integrating Anki's scheduler improvements

---

## Executive Summary
[Provide: High-level recommendation on implementation approach]

## Current Danki vs Anki Gaps

### Algorithm Differences
[Analyze: What Danki is missing compared to Anki]

**Current Danki**: Basic SM-2 with [1, 10] minute learning steps  
**Anki Standard**: [Document current Anki implementation]

### Feature Gaps
[Document: Missing features that would improve user experience]

### Performance Gaps  
[Analyze: Areas where Anki's optimizations would help]

## Recommended Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Enhanced SM-2 (Priority: HIGH)
[Recommend: Immediate improvements to current system]

**Timeline**: 1-2 sessions  
**Benefits**: [List concrete user benefits]  
**Implementation**: 

```python
# Template - show how to enhance current scheduler
class EnhancedSM2Scheduler(Scheduler):
    def __init__(self):
        # Anki-style improvements to implement
        pass
        
    def calculate_interval(self, card, rating):
        # Enhanced calculation based on Anki's approach
        pass
```

**Specific Changes**:
- [ ] Improved ease factor handling
- [ ] Better learning step sequences  
- [ ] Enhanced lapse logic
- [ ] Anki-style deck options

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Priority: MEDIUM)
[Recommend: Additional Anki features to implement]

**Timeline**: 2-3 sessions  
**Features to Add**:
- [ ] Sibling card burying
- [ ] Advanced daily limit handling
- [ ] Better timezone support
- [ ] Enhanced statistics

### Phase 3: FSRS Integration (Priority: FUTURE)
[Recommend: Modern algorithm implementation]

**Timeline**: 2-3 sessions  
**Approach**: [Recommend implementation strategy]

## Architecture Recommendations

### New Scheduler Structure
[Design: How to restructure Danki's scheduler]

```python
# Template - recommended architecture
class SchedulerFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_scheduler(algorithm: str) -> BaseScheduler:
        if algorithm == "sm2_enhanced":
            return EnhancedSM2Scheduler()
        elif algorithm == "fsrs":
            return FsrsScheduler()
        
class BaseScheduler(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def build_session(self) -> List[Card]:
        pass
        
    @abstractmethod
    def answer_card(self, card: Card, rating: Rating) -> None:
        pass
```

### Database Migration Strategy
[Plan: How to upgrade existing Danki databases]

**New Tables Needed**:
```sql
-- Template - additional tables for Anki compatibility
CREATE TABLE scheduler_config (
    deck_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    algorithm TEXT NOT NULL,
    options JSON NOT NULL
);
```

**Migration Steps**:
1. [ ] Add new columns to existing tables
2. [ ] Create migration scripts for card data
3. [ ] Preserve user learning history
4. [ ] Update schema version tracking

## Backwards Compatibility Plan

### Data Migration
[Plan: Preserving existing user data]

### Algorithm Fallback
[Design: Graceful handling of algorithm switches]

### Settings Migration
[Plan: Converting current preferences to Anki format]

## Performance Optimization Strategy

### Database Optimizations
[Recommend: Indexing and query improvements from Anki]

### Caching Strategy
[Recommend: What to cache for better performance]

### Memory Management
[Analyze: Anki's approach to handling large card collections]

## Testing Strategy

### Algorithm Validation
[Plan: How to verify our implementation matches Anki's]

**Test Approach**:
```python
# Template - testing framework for scheduler validation
class SchedulerTestSuite:
    def test_interval_calculation_vs_anki(self):
        # Compare our implementation with Anki's results
        pass
        
    def test_learning_sequence_compatibility(self):
        # Ensure learning steps work like Anki's
        pass
```

### Regression Testing
[Plan: Ensuring changes don't break existing functionality]

### User Experience Testing
[Plan: Validating that changes improve learning outcomes]

## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risks
